Typos are easy to make - being able to compare recent versions of code to quickly find issues/typos/bugs and correct them is helpful.

You would be able to see if you make the same types of mistakes repeatedly and
better work to correct them.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
It allows for more control over saving versions that are sensible and work,
rather than at arbitrary points, possibly even mid-word.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git is more designed for projects consisting of multiple code files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
you can use those commands to see recent changes, what's been added/removed, etc.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

I'd know I could confidently restore a prior version if I messed something up.

I want to use git to be proficient and efficient at work!
